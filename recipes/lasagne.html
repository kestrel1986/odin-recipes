            <li>100g dried red split lentils</li>
            <li>2 x 400g tin chopped tomatoes</li>
            <li>2 tsp Italian seasoning or oregano</li>
            <li>1 tsp sugar, any kind</li>
            <li>1 vegan vegetable stock cube</li>
            <li>150g fresh spinach leaves</li>
            <li>9-10 dried vegan pasta sheets, <strong>ensure egg free</strong></li>
            <li>salt and ground black pepper</li>
        </ul>
        <p>For the white sauce:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>3 tsp sunflower oil</li>
            <li>100g plain flour</li>
            <li>800ml almond milk</li>
            <li>3 tbsp nutritional yeast flakes</li>
            <li>1 bay leaf <em>optional</em></li>
            <li>quarter tsp ground nutmeg</li>
            <li>salt and ground black pepper</li>
        </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 200C/180C Fan/Gas 6.</li>
            <li>Heat the olive oil in a large, non-stick saucepan and fry the onion for 3–4 minutes, or until softened and lightly browned, stirring. Add the aubergine, courgette, pepper and mushrooms and fry for 12 minutes, stirring regularly.</li>
            <li>Add the garlic and cook for a few seconds more, then stir in the red lentils, tomatoes, Italian seasoning, sugar and crumbled stock cube.</li>
            <li>Refill one of the tomato tins with water (400ml/14fl oz) and pour into the pan. Stir well, bring to a simmer and cook for 15 minutes, stirring regularly. Add the spinach leaves, a handful at a time and cook for 1–2 minutes more.</li>
            <li>While the vegetables are simmering, make the white sauce. Heat the oil in a medium saucepan. When it is hot add the flour and cook, stirring all the time, for 1 minute. Stir in the milk, yeast, bay leaf and nutmeg and season well with salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Bring to a simmer, whisking constantly with a metal whisk over a moderate heat for 4–5 minutes, or until smooth and thickened. (Use a silicone covered whisk if using a non-stick saucepan.) Adjust the seasoning to taste – you’ll need more black pepper than you might imagine.</li>
            <li>Spread a third of the vegetable mixture over the base of a 2½ –3 litre/4½– 5 pints ovenproof lasagne dish and cover with a single layer of lasagne sheets. Top with another third of the vegetable mixture (don’t worry if it doesn’t cover evenly) and a second layer of lasagne.</li>
            <li>Pour over just under half of the white sauce, after removing the bay leaf, and very gently top with the remaining vegetable mixture. Finish with a final layer of lasagne and the rest of the white sauce.</li>
            <li>Bake for 35–40 minutes, or the pasta has softened and the topping is nicely browned and bubbling. Stand for 5 minutes before cutting to allow the filling to settle.</li>
        </ol>
