            <li>1 heaped tablespoon self-raising flour</li>

            <li>60 g shelled unsalted pistachios (optional)</li>
            <li>100 g soya yoghurt</li>
            <li>hot chilli sauce</li>
        </ul>
        <p>For the salad pickle:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>1 pomegranate</li>
            <li>red wine vinegar</li>
            <li>extra virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>1 red onion</li>
            <li>1-2 fresh mixed-colour chillies</li>
            <li>1 cucumber</li>
            <li>1-2 mixed-colour carrots</li>
            <li>1 bunch of fresh mint (30g)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>For the hummus:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>1 x 660 g jar of chickpeas</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon unsweetened peanut butter</li>
            <li>half a garlic clove</li>
            <li>1 lemon</li>
            <li>15g fresh parsley</li>
            <li>olive oil</li>
            <li>quarter teaspoon of sweet smoked paprika</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon of dukkah</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Steps</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>To make the salad pickle, squeeze half the pomegranate juice into a large, shallow bowl. Top it up with an equal amount of red wine vinegar, then drizzle over some extra virgin olive oil and give it all a good mix.</li>
                <li>Peel and finely slice the red onion, finely slice the chillies (deseed if you like), matchstick the cucumber (I like to use a crinkle-cut knife) and shave the carrots into ribbons, then combine it all in the bowl.</li>
                <li>Holding the remaining pomegranate half cut-side down, bash it with the back of a wooden spoon so the seeds tumble out over the salad. Pick and tear over half the mint leaves, then gently toss and leave aside until needed.</li>
                <li>For the houmous, tip half the jar of chickpeas into a food processor and season with sea salt and black pepper. Add the peanut butter and 2 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil, peel and add the garlic, finely grate in half the lemon zest and squeeze in all the juice. Whiz until super-smooth, then transfer to a shallow serving bowl. Pick over a few parsley leaves and drizzle with a little extra virgin olive oil.</li>
                <li>Spoon 2 tablespoons of the chickpeas into a non-stick frying pan over a medium heat with 1 tablespoon of olive oil. Sprinkle over the paprika and dukkah, and cook for 5 minutes, or until the chickpeas are crisp, then tip over the houmous.</li>
                <li>For the falafel fritters, place the remaining chickpeas and mint leaves into the food processor, along with the peas and self-raising flour. Quarter the preserved lemon, removing any pips, and pulse until combined.</li>
                <li>Drizzle 1 tablespoon of olive oil into a large frying pan over a medium heat, then dollop in heaped teaspoons of the falafel batter. Fry for 4 minutes on each side, or until golden, sprinkling over the cumin seeds when you flip them.</li>
                <li>Now itâ€™s time to bring everything together. Warm the flatbreads in the oven for a few minutes and crush the pistachios (if using) in a pestle and mortar. Put the soya yoghurt into a bowl and stir in a few dashes of chilli sauce. Load up your flatbreads with a bit of everything, pick over the remaining parsley leaves, then roll up and tuck in!</li>
            </ol>
